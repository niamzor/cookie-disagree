**Cookie disagree** is a chrome extension that automatically disagrees with GDPR cookie. It saves you the chore to deny and block these cookies of every single website.

## Installation


### From the Chrome Web Store

Not available yet, cause I don't want to pay 5$.

### From your hard drive

Clone the repository on your hard drive and then load it unpacked from chrome. A complete guide can be found on the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/#unpacked" target="_blank">chrome developer website</a>.
